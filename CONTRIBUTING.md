# Contributing to @fivexlabs/ng-headless-datagrid

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ng-headless-datagrid.git
cd ng-headless-datagrid

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the library
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Build and watch for changes during development
npm run build:watch
```
